## Project Description
This project answers the project assignment from "Coursera getting and cleaning data"
Specifically, it transforms a raw data set into a tidy dataset.

Files: 
 - README.md - general description of the project
 - codebook.txt - the present file
 - run_analysis.R - script transforming the raw data into a tidy dataset
 - tidy.txt - the tidy dataset

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
 The raw data is provided here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
 Please refer to the readme in the raw data zip archive for further information.

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
Please refer to the readme in the raw data zip archive for further information.

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
To create the tidy data file, please :
- download and extract the raw data into your home folder. This will create a folder named ~/UCI HAR Dataset
- run the R script run_analysis.R, with the command "source('run_analysis.R', echo=TRUE)"

###Cleaning of the data
The cleaning script does the following operations: 
1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Please refer to the readme.txt for further details.

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
The tidy dataset (tidy.txt) has following properties:
 - Dimensions of the dataset: 180 x 61
 - Summary of the data: the data presents means per subject and activity for a subset of variables present in the raw dataset
 - Variables present in the dataset:
"subject" "activity" "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
"tBodyAcc-std()-X" "tBodyAcc-std()-Y" "tBodyAcc-std()-Z" "tGravityAcc-mean()-X"
